 /** Memory Compare Function, memcmp
  * The memcmp() function shall compare the first n bytes
  * (each interpreted as an unsigned char) of the object
  * pointed to by s1 to the first n bytes of the object
  * pointed to by s2.
  *
  * The sign of the non-zero return value shall be
  * determined by the sign of the difference between
  * the values of the first pair of bytes (both
  * interpreted as type unsigned char) that differ in
  * the objects being compared.
  *
  * @param  s1 1st memory location used in comparison.
  * @param  s2 2nd memory location used in comparison.
  * @param  n  Size of bytes to compare s1 and s2.
  * @return    Comparison results.
