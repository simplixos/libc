/** Memory Move Function, memmove
 * The memmove() function shall copy n bytes from the
 * object pointed to by s2 into the object pointed to
 * by s1. Copying takes place as if the n bytes from the
 * object pointed to by s2 are first copied into a temporary
 * array of n bytes that does not overlap the objects
 * pointed to by s1 and s2, and then the n bytes from the
 * temporary array are copied into the object pointed to
 * by s1.
 *
 * @param  s1 Destination memory location used in move
 * @param  s2 Source memory location used in move
 * @param  n  Number of bytes to move from s2 to s1
 * @return    Destination memory location pointed to by s1.
